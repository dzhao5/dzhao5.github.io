	<p>My name is Dan Dan Zhao. I am graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in West Virgina, May 21, 2016. I am currently a freshman at University at Buffalo. My major is computer science and I want to become a computer programmmer because I think the games for now are repeating each other and I want to create a type of game can be combine the life players and combat player together in the game. For now, most games are always combats with some life or life with some combats. So I want to create a game that can make players feel the game is an another world for them.</p>

 	<h2>Watch videos</h2>
 	<p>Video would makes me laugh. When I am tired, I likes to watch videos to make my mind relax.
 	<h2>Coding</h2>
 	<p>Coding makes me tired, but also successful. but I would feel successful and happy about when I can finish the coding</p>
 	<h2>Read books</h2>
 	<p>There is time I do not want to touch computers. I am too tired for coding. So I would take out the books and read it, it would make me enter another world and learned a lot things that I cannot learn from classes.</p>
 	<h2>Play games</h2>
 	<p>I love to play games, especially online games. when I am playing the games, I can discover another world and it would makes me more passion about to learn more about computer science. It also is why I never think give up about to be a compute programmer.</p>
